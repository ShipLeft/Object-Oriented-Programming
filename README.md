# Object-Oriented-Programming
### Added the repository and the README file.

My name is Rhett Boatright and I am currently enrolled in software developement at Southwest Technical College.

This is the conglomeration of all of the assignments that I will be completing in the future, from programs to command line assignments to any other applicable data. These are necessary for the completion of the program I am enrolled in as well as important for future job opportunities for myself.

I am 22 years old and live in St. George, Utah. I have worked in various places from being a CNA to factory work to fast food. I have always enjoyed working with technology and I am loving being able to learn how to make programs so that I might be able to work in this field in the future.

I am taking this program because I really enjoy working with computers and I thought that I may be able to enjoy the software building side of it as well. This program is also able to help me get out of working at high school level jobs where I feel that I may be wasting my potential. This would allow me to grow my knowledge around technology and what it actually takes to create programs. My end goals: 1. being able to attain a job in this field of work, 2. being able to understand how to write programs and being able to create programs that can help myself or others, 3. be able to see if this is the field that I would like to continue learning about past this program.
